A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer when you use the Play2Health World DAO App or Play2Health World DAO Website(s). This helps us to provide you with a better experience when you use the Play2Health World DAO App or browse the Play2Help World DAO website(s) and also allows us to improve the Services.
